# CS425-Project

## Software Requirements
- python3 (I have python 3.10.9)
- NodeJS

## Setup
- in the root directory run "pip3 install django"

## How to run/test code
- in the root directory run "python manage.py runserver"
- this should give a link in terminal for a local host running the website
- if it doesn't work you might need an extension if you are on vscode
- I use Live Server (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## How the files are organized
Everything is under the real_estate folder

HTML Files
- under templates\real_estate
- feel free to add more html files or change them
- if you make a new html file let me know how/where you want me to connect the page to the overall website (unless you know how to do it yourself)
- some of the html files are used as layout templates for other html files refer to default.html and customerHome.html to see an example of what I mean

JavaScript
- under static\real_estate
- customerHome.html should have an example of importing js files into the right html file
